- put timing values in config
- Ping/Pong for crap networks - not in irclj alpha! build our own?

more commands:
- leave / join a room
- details of a commit
- watch / unwatch projects and other tasks

done:
- switch to core.async to handle threads and states and messages
- send responses to help/quit publicly instead of DM
- quit should actually kill the process!  (might wait until we go core.async)
