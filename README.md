# gitlabbot

An IRC bot to watch gitlab commits

## Usage

At the moment this is in active development, and running it probably requires hacking code. sorry.

Also there's some horrible stuff in here. Avoid.  Mostly just on github so I can share it with work pc.

This is based on my also-hacky buildbot project - I should end up extracting common stuff to a bot library.

I started this using lazybot, but it was a bit complex, and the mongodb dependency made it too hard to run at work,
so decided to roll my own...
